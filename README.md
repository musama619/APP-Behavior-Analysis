- Created a model with 77% accuracy that will label the users with 'Likely' or 'Unlikely' to subscribe or enroll.
- We can market our product where we know the users are likely to susbcribe and this can help in increasing subscription rate

#### Findings

- More the number of screens user visits increases the chance of subscribing more
- Old age users are less likely to subscribe
- Young users play mini games more than old users and are more likely to subscribe
- Users who have access to premium features are less likely to subscribe
